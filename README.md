Implementation of ADM4 in [Learning Social Infectivity in Sparse Low-rank Networks Using Multi-dimensional Hawkes Processes](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v31/zhou13a.pdf). 
### ADM4
Python implementation of ADM4 based on matrix computation. [Tick](https://github.com/X-DataInitiative/tick) provides a more 
mature implementation, but if you prefer a pure pythonic implementation, my version is a good choice.
